### SablierV2LockupDynamic Contract Walkthrough

- This is a review and walkthrough of the SablierV2LockupDynamic smart contract, which uses Segments, milestones and delta for calculation of the custom streaming curve, which determines how the payment rate varies over time.

- [Sablier](https://sablier.com/) is a token streaming protocol developed with Ethereum smart contracts, designed to facilitate `by-the-second` payments for cryptocurrencies, specifically `ERC20`assets.
- The protocol employs a set of persistent and non-upgradable smart contracts that prioritize security, censorship resistance, self-custody, and functionality without the need for trusted intermediaries who may selectively restrict access.
